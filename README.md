# Vanilla-js-vs-J-Query

Guten Morgen?? This morning's exercise is supposed to familiarise programmes with some functionalities of the popular Javascript Library called J-Query. In this exercise, you will be given a card with some identifiers on it, let us call them selectors. The first selector is a HTML Tag followed by a Class and an ID. Your instructor will then select some peole based on these selectors and tell them what to do.
```
1. 

<details>
<summary>
<i>Vanilla Dom Says:- If you hava a className one please stand up</i>
</summary>
<p>No one is supposed to stand, there is no className one, this would ot be a problem with J-Query because it allows you to use CSS selectors </p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>
<i>J-Query Says:- If you have a selector b please stand up</i>
</summary>
<p>There is no need to be very specific about the selector, there is a universal selector method "$" that allows you to use any CSS selector </p>
</details>

```
```
2. 

<details>
<summary>
<i>Vanilla Dom Says:- For all elements that are P tags, if your class is red and your ID is the third index counting from the first index of an array stand please stand up</i>
</summary>
<p>This demonstrates how it is harder to translate vanilla js to natural language as opposed to jquery</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>
<i>J-Query Says:- If you are a P tag with id 2 please stand up</i>
</summary>
<p>It is harder to get lost in translation using J-Query elements are selected using eq() </p>
</details>

```
3. 
```
<details>
<summary>
<i>Vanilla Dom Says:- Each element that has a class of green, please stand in the order of the id</i>
</summary>
<p>This should demonstrate the complexity of having to select an array of all similarly named tags and have to loop through them to do something </p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>
<i>J-Query Says:- If you have an IMG tag please stand[</i>
</summary>
<p>This is a much simpler way of effecting changes to all tags with a similar selector. </p>
</details>

```
