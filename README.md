Guten Morgen?? This morning's exercise is supposed to familiarise programmes with some functionalities of the popular Javascript Library called J-Query. In this exercise, you will be given a card with some identifiers on it, let us call them selectors. The first selector is a HTML Tag followed by a Class and an ID. Your instructor will then select some peole based on these selectors and tell them what to do.
